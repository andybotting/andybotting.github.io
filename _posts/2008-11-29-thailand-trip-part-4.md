Once we realised how much Stable lodge was really costing us, we upgraded our accommodation for the four nights we had in Bangkok. We booked a serviced apartment at Citiadines in Sukhumvit 8, just down the road from Stable Lodge.

_Messy bed at Citadines_

We booked it on [Wotif](http://www.wotif.com) and it cost us a little bit more than what Stable Lodge was. It was totally worth it for the comfortable bed alone, especially after sleeping on really hard and really soft beds at the other places.

Somehow we ended up wth four nights in Bangkok with was way too much. If you&#8217;re going to Thailand, only spend a few days in Bangers at a maximum. It&#8217;s just not that exciting. It&#8217;s too similar to Melbourne really. Trains, shopping centers, etc.

We checked out the **massive** MBK shopping center and the King Power duty free place too. If you see King Power anywhere.. avoid it. Don&#8217;t waste your time, it&#8217;s fancy stuff that is way overpriced.

The last night in Bangkok, we found out about the semi-permanent beer gardens that get set up outside the CentralWorld shopping center. The beer garden for the Thai beer _Singha_, must have had some association with the Japanese beer Asahi, which just happens to be my favourite beer. So, you can imagine my excitement to find out they were serving it there.

_The Asahi tower_

Bek and I polished off a _tower_ of Asahi. The tower is a 3 litre tube full of beer with a column of ice down the middle to keep it cold and a tap on the bottom to pour. It was awesome. I thought about how good it would be to do a similar thing in Melbourne, but I realised that it just wouldn&#8217;t work because it would get abused. People would be getting smashed and then smashing each other (like going to any pub in the city these days). The Thai people don&#8217;t drink that much and are very passive. It&#8217;s nice to walk around at any time and feel totally safe.

_All gone_

We had trouble getting a taxi to the airport when it was time to leave. The guy at the hotel mentioned something about a bomb, but we didn&#8217;t know anything else. Finally a taxi arrived who was willing to take us. This guy was crazy. He had this strange twitch in his seat while he was driving. He was doing 130 km/h down the freeway, which had 80 signs. Weaving through traffic and flashing his lights at anyone slowing him down. We also didn&#8217;t have any seat belts.

Closer to the airport, we started seeing lots of people in yellow shirts with plastic hand clappers. I had no idea who they were until later. They were protesters heading towards the airport to shut it down.

_Protester convoy_

We managed to get most of the way to the airport before traffic stopped moving. Bek and I had to put our backpacks on and walk the last km to the terminal. It was pretty exciting actually. We were so lucky to get our fight, because not long after, the protesters stormed the terminal and all flights got shut down. It must have been only an hour or two after we left.

Their aim was to stop their prime minister from getting into the country, from Peru where the APEC summit was held. It seems they don&#8217;t like him very much&#8230; and it&#8217;s a long story.

A nine hour flight and we touched down in Melbourne. First stop, the Classic Curry Company ðŸ™‚
