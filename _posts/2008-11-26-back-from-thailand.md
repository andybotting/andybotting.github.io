As you may have heard, protests have been going on in Bangkok recently. It seems to be about the Thai people wanting their prime minister to resign.

We finally got a taxi from our hotel to the airport, after many taxi&#8217;s refused to take us. The guy who did end up taking us was a bit crazy, and he was going 130 km/h down the 80 km/h freeway and our seatbelts didn&#8217;t work.

Protesters were stopping traffic a few kilometers from the airport. Traffic was crawling from there towards the airport, with people wearing yellow shirts yelling a going crazy.

We managed to almost make it all the way to the airport, but we had to get our and walk the last bit, which wasn&#8217;t too bad. News says that the airport was closed shortly after, so we were probably lucky.

The Age has an article: [Protesters storm Bangkok airport](http://www.theage.com.au/world/protesters-storm-bangkok-airport-20081126-6hmo.html) which might give some insight about what is going on in Bangkok right now.

I&#8217;ve got more to write about our holiday, but that might have to come tomorrow.
