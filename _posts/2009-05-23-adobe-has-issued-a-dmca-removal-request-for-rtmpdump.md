It seems that Adobe, after issuing a [press release](http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200901/012009RTMP.html) claiming they would be opening up the RTMP protocol in the &#8216;first half of 2009&#8217;, have issued a DMCA take down request for an open source implementation of the protocol, RTMPdump. The SourceForge project site for RTMPdump now shows &#8216;Invalid Project&#8217;.

This is going to mean it&#8217;s going to become much harder to get RTMPdump for downloading copies of ABC&#8217;s iView files, which I [previously](/abcs-iview-on-xbmc-update-1) [posted](/abcs-iview-on-xbmc-update-2) [about](/iview-for-xbmc-plugin-v02). This might also have interesting consequences for XBMC and Boxee which both include this code for supporting streaming media from BBC&#8217;s iPlayer.

This is pretty disappointing from Adobe, especially after claiming they would be in the process of opening up the protocol.
