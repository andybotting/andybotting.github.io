I&#8217;ve been slowly doing some bits and pieces for a new Tram Hunter web site. I would now like to announce the new site at <http://tramhunter.andybotting.com/>.

Since v0.5 of Tram Hunter, we&#8217;ve included an option to send anonymous usage statistics to a server I have running on Google&#8217;s App Engine. My main aim was to generate some heat maps, based on the location of tram stop requests.

You can now see the final version of the [heap map](http://tramhunter.andybotting.com/stats/map/), which is generated nightly, from the latest 1000 requests. It turns out to be quite interesting to look at.

I&#8217;m also using the Google Chart API to generate some nice [pie charts](http://tramhunter.andybotting.com/stats/chart/) showing some other info like [handset model](http://tramhunter.andybotting.com/stats/chart/device_model), [Android version](http://tramhunter.andybotting.com/stats/chart/device_version) and [mobile networks](http://tramhunter.andybotting.com/stats/chart/mobile_network_number).

In other Tram Hunter news, the latest stats from the Android Market show <span><strong>5687</strong></span> total installs, with <span><strong>4293</strong></span> active installs (<span>75%</span>). We also have a **4.85** rating out of 5, with **255** comments. The comments are all really positive, so it definitely makes development worthwhile.

I&#8217;ve created a new Twitter account for Tram Hunter, so for the latest updates, follow [@tram_hunter](http://twitter.com/tram_hunter).
