It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve posted on here, but I wanted to share something cool that I found.

It&#8217;s called the <a href="http://sportstracker.nokia.com" target="_blank">Nokia Sports Tracker</a> and you can use it for tracking your workouts. As friends of mine will know, I do a bit of running. Sometimes it&#8217;s handy to know how far you&#8217;ve gone or how quickly you did it in.

Just put your recent Nokia phone with built-in GPS (or add a bluetooth GPS unit, if you don&#8217;t have it built in) in your pocket when you go running, cycling, walking to track your distance and speed. What&#8217;s really cool is that if you have mobile internet access, you can send your data in real-time so others can see your progress plotted on a google maps interface.

Last Saturday, I decided to try it out. You can check out my run details here:
